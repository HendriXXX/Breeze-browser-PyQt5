# Breeze web browser (PyQt5)

Breeze is a simple and experimental web browser created using ChatGPT (GPT-4o). It is made for Haiku OS, but it should work with Windows and Linux (and probably macOS) too.

Note: This code is generated by AI, so it's probably good idea you to review it before running.

# Features
- basic navigation buttons
- floating/movable navigation toolbar
- tabbed browsing
- video/sound playback
- bookmarks, with add, renaming and removal option
- simple file download manager with progress bar and cancel possibility

Note: There is no adblock included in browser, so in Haiku OS install and configure hblock for that purpose.

# Dependencies

Haiku OS:
- python 3.10 (probably works fine with older version too, not tested)
- pyqt5_python310
- pyqtwebengine5_python310

Other operating systems:
- Install equivalent Python 3.10 and PyQt5 libraries for your OS.
